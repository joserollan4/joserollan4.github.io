### Love letter sa ni nakos akong asawa ha (no probset this week)

Dearest V,

Merry Christmas, lover!

When it comes to love, I may be the worst guy to seek advice to. I'm just a weird guy to loves to do math, play sports and code random stuff like this (not necessarily a love letter though). However, when my eyes met yours over and over again, you became the best plot twist of the year and in my life in general.

V, thank you for existing! I know this may sound cringe to you (hey it's my first time writing one) but I just want to let you know how I feel towards you. I can recall the days since we started competing back at grade-school, then during junior high where I gave you a cute nickname, I'm good at making nicknames baya :p. 

Fast forward to now I guess I made my case that I am into you (sorry for annoying u for the last few days hahaha). You just being yourself instantly adds color and brightens up my day. Your cutie smile and our little small talks make my whole world bloom with your favorite flowers. Bb, always remember that you are loved (by me ofc) and by the people around you. You're the cutest, prettiest, sweetest, smartest, most responsible human out there that I know and I appreciate you and I'm proud of u at everything that you do. Keep on slaying, vv!

I understand that love or having a significant other is not the first thing on the top of your mind. V, I'll always be here waiting for you until the stars align for the both of us while always doing my best to remain consistent with my actions towards you, even if it's only snagging a minute of your time. I'll always be here for you, cheering on every milestone you accomplish with grace and someone you can open up to on anything if things don't go your way. I'll do what I can to learn how to love every single triat of you with all my pure intentions. And don't worry about me, I've got my future straight, hopefully, with you by my side. I gotchu always, V!

All my love, 
Paopao
