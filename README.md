# ngano_math_na Summer Camp
A fun mathematics training program for math enthusiasts in northern Cebu
### Rationale
The interest in competitive math among creative problem solvers has been rising constantly in northern Cebu. Over the past couple of years, students of the City of Bogo as well as other municipalities in northern Cebu have been participating in  various online and onsite mathematics competitions across the local, national and even in the international level. In particular there have been at least 2 students from the said area who have qualified to the Area Stage of the Philippine Mathematical Olympiad, the most prestigious math competition for high school students in the country, with 1 student winning a medal on that stage. These numbers are expected to rise in the coming years.

As an effort to give back to the math community, I (Jose Mari Paolo Rollan), along with other talented math enthusiasts will host the **ngano_math_na Summer Camp**! The program is a two-week mathematics training camp open to interested high school math enthusiasts. The name is derived from my username *ngano_upat_na*, which I frequently use in online math and programming contests.

### Structure
The camp will run for ten days. In the first half of the camp, we'll be focusing on how to solve contest problems using standard math concepts taught in school and then shift to concepts taught outside of the school curriculum in the second half of the program. 

Each day starts with a lecture along some problem solving discussions. During the fifth and tenth day of the camp, a mini-contest will be organized to end the day, wherein the tenth day serves as a final exam. Otherwise, it will just be a quick 40-minute quiz. The will be breaks in-between lectures. Students are provided with hand-outs for each lecture.

### Logistics
**Modality**: To be announced. (Although, we're most likely to lean on going onsite. We just need a venue. If your school/place is interested in hosting the camp for two weeks, please feel free to contact me.)

**Venue**: To be announced (depending on the modality)

**Date**: To be announced (most likely during the third to fourth week of June)

### Eligibility 
A student who will study in a Bogohanon high school for the next school year (SY 2024-2025) is eligible to register. 

Depending on the number of slots available, students studying in schools outside Bogo may still be eligible.

### Registration
**Application Form**: To be posted

Please do note that this is NOT in a first-come-first-serve basis. There will be a short assessment in the form to test the student's math background. Students will get accepted to the program based on their performance in the assessment and the number of slots available. In addition, a school may have no more than **six** participants in the program.
