Hello reader!

For the past four years, the City of Bogo has yet to have a local math competition that will serve as a gateway for talented Bogohanon problem solvers to test their skills in the field of math. As a way to give back to the mathematics community in the City of Bogo, and with the skills I learned as a problem setter and competitor, I decided to host a friendly online mathematics competition open to the general public!

Introducing, the **Bogohanon Master in Mathematics**!
